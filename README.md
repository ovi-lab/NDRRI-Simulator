# DReyeVROFR
This simulator is an extension of [DReyeVR](https://github.com/HARPLab/DReyeVR) simulator developed by HARPLab at Carnigie Mellon University. This simulator was developed to run a study that explored different text presentation techniques for Non-Driving Related Tasks (NDRTs). Furthermore, we also explored the impact of using audio assistance for the secondary reading tasks.
This simulator is capable of logging Handover performance metrics such as Standard deviation in Lane Position (SDLP), Maximum Steering Angle Velocity (MSAV), etc. when connected to Logitech Steering Wheel and pedals.
