Swimmers are called accordingly: a breast-stroke swimmer, a crawl-stroke swimmer, a long-distance swimmer, a short-distance swimmer, a medium-distance swimmer, a first relay swimmer, the last relay swimmer, etc. Swimming makes people strong and healthy, it develops all parts of the body. By and large, sportsmen keep themselves in good form by training in swimming. There are some rules about swimming that are essential for all.
