I am often asked whether we will do anything about the taxes we all have to pay. Of course, what people mean is that they don't want to pay so much. But I have to ask in return which services they would like to lose. We cannot expect to have modern hospitals, well-kept roads, good schools, or attractive parks if we are not prepared to pay for these things.
Our children do not think that schools and colleges are only for the sons and daughters of the rich, as once they were. More and more of us are living longer and longer. We all feel that we should be able to see a doctor when we need to. Old people should not suffer because they are afraid of the doctor's bill. In our society, we are proud of the fact that no one is asked whether they can pay the bill before they are allowed into a hospital.
But if we want to continue to provide for all the needs of our society, we must remember that nothing in life is free. My party does not promise to cut taxes immediately. But we do promise to continue all the services that our taxes pay for, and we hope that we will manage things so well that after a short time some taxes may be reduced.
