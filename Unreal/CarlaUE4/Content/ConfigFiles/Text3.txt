In developing countries, where three-fourths of the world's population live, sixty percent of the people who can't read and write are women. Being illiterate doesn't mean they are not intelligent. It does mean it is difficult for them to change their lives. They produce more than half of the food. In Africa, eighty percent of all agricultural work is done by women. There are many programs to help poor countries develop their agriculture. However, for years, these programs provided money and training for men. In parts of Africa, this is a typical day for a village woman. At 4:45 am, she gets up, washes and eats.
It takes her a half-hour to walk to the fields, and she works there until 3:00 p.m. She collects firewood and gets home at 4:00. She spends the next hour and a half preparing food to cook. Then she collects water for another hour. From 6:30 to 8:30 she cooks. After dinner, she spends an hour washing the dishes and her children. She goes to bed at 9:30 p.m. International organizations and programs run by developed nations are starting to help women, as well as men, improve their agricultural production. Governments have already passed some laws affecting women because of the United Nations Decade for Women. The United Nations Organization (UNO) report will affect the changes now happening in the family and society.
