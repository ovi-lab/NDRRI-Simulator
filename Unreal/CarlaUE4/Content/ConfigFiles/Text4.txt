Simply being bilingual doesn't qualify someone to interpret. Interpreting is not only a mechanical process of converting one sentence in a particular language into the same sentence in language another language. Rather, it's a complex art in which thoughts and idioms that have no obvious counterparts from tongue to tongue and words that have several meanings must be quickly transformed in such a way that the message is clearly and accurately expressed to the listener.
At one international conference, an American speaker said, "You can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear", which meant nothing to the Spanish audience. The interpretation was, "A monkey in a silk dress is still a monkey", which is an idiom the Spanish understood and that expressed the same idea.
There are two kinds of interpreters, simultaneous and consecutive. The former, sitting in a separated booth, usually at a large multilingual conference, speaks to listeners wearing headphones, interpreting what a foreign language speaker says while being a sentence behind in interpreting. Consecutive interpreters are the ones most international negotiations use. They are employed for smaller meetings without sound booths and headphones. Consecutive interpretation also requires two-person teams. A foreign speaker says his piece while the interpreter, using a special shorthand, takes notes and during a pause, tells the client what was said.
